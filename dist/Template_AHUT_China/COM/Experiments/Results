        <h2>1. Construction of the engineered E. coli BL21(DE3) expressing soluble sTRAIL and ISZ-sTRAIL protein</h2>
        <p>Basing on the sequence of an existing part of sTRAIL (<partinfo name="K1166004"></partinfo>), we have added an isoleucine zipper (ISZ) to the N-terminal of this part and constructed a new part <partinfo name="K3981014"></partinfo> (pET28a-his-linker-ISZ-sTRAIL, ISZ-sTRAIL for short, Fig. 1), which could generate the trimeric form of TRAIL and increased its antitumor potential.</p>

        <h3>1.1. Construction of sTRAIL and ISZ-sTRAIL vectors</h3>
        <p>Firstly, the original coding sequence of sTRAIL (<partinfo name="K1166004"></partinfo>) were synthesized by company, and cloned into the pET-28a (+) expression vectors. The correctness of the recombinant plasmids was verified by PCR (Fig. 2).</p>

        <p>Then, we designed the primers for PCR amplification of ISZ-sTRAIL gene fragments, and obtained the ISZ-sTRAIL gene (666bp) via PCR using pET28a-his-linker-her2-linker-ISZ-sTRAIL(BBa_K3981015) as the template (Fig. 3).</p> 
        <img-fluid alt="Results_03" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/5/54/T--AHUT_China--ImprovedParts_03.png" caption="Fig. 3 Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of ISZ-sTRAIL. M: Marker; 1: ISZ-sTRAIL PCR bands, the length was 666 bp"></img-fluid>
        <p>The desired ISZ-sTRAIL gene fragments were cloned into pET-28a (+) expression vectors, then the constructed recombinant plasmids were identified by double digestion with Nco I and Xho I restriction enzymes, and the band was determined to be about 666 bp (the arrow indicated in Fig. 4). Subsequently, the sequencing results of recombinant plasmids were consistent with the target gene (Fig. 5), which indicated that ISZ-sTRAIL plasmids were successfully constructed.</p>

        <h3>1.2. Expression and purification of sTRAIL and ISZ-sTRAIL proteins</h3>
        <p>The correct sTRAIL and ISZ-sTRAIL vectors were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) respectively, and positive colonies were selected on a Luria–Bertani (LB) agar plate with kanamycin to create the engineered strains BL21(DE3)/sTRAIL and BL21(DE3)/ISZ-sTRAIL. Then, the expressions of sTRAIL and ISZ-sTRAIL were induced with 0.5-0.8 mmol/L isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. As shown in Fig. 6 (bands 1-2) and Fig.7 (bands 1 and 3), sTRAIL and ISZ-sTRAIL proteins could be both successfully expressed under IPTG induction.</p> 
        <p>Further, the sTRAIL and recombinant ISZ-sTRAIL were purified by His affinity chromatography and determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie brilliant blue staining. The result showed that sTRAIL and recombinant ISZ-sTRAIL proteins were purified with high purity as indicated by a significant single protein band after SDS-PAGE in Fig. 6 (band 3) and Fig.7 (band 2).</p>

        <h3>1.3. Anti-tumor activity of sTRAIL and ISZ-sTRAIL proteins</h3>
        <p>After efficient purification of sTRAIL and ISZ-sTRAIL proteins, we tested their anti-tumor activity on MCF7 breast cancer cells. Cell morphology pictures (Fig. 8) and MTT assay (Fig. 9) showed that both sTRAIL and ISZ-sTRAIL proteins could inhibit the proliferation of MCF7 cells, and the improved part of ISZ-TRAIL demonstrated increased potential anti-proliferation activity than the original part of sTRAIL.</p>

        <h2>2.Construction of the engineered E. coli BL21(DE3) expressing soluble Her2-ISZ-sTRAILprotein</h2>
        <p>Based on the ISZ-sTRAIL expression vectors, a sequence of Her2-affibody, which could increase the target effect of ISZ-sTRAIL, was added to the N-terminus of ISZ-sTRAIL plasmid to construct a new part of pET-28a(+)-His-linker-Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL (BBa_K3981015, Her2- ISZ-sTRAIL for short) recombinant vector.</p> 
        <h3>2.1. Construction of Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL expression plasmid</h3>
        <p>The coding sequence of Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL with a His-tag were designed by our group, then synthesized and cloned into pET-28a(+) expression vector by company. Fig.10 showed the map of the obtained pET-28a(+)-His-linker-Her2- ISZ-sTRAIL recombinant plasmid.</p>
        <img-fluid alt="Results_10" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/6/6f/T--AHUT_China--ProofOfConcept_01.png" caption="Fig 10. Map of Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL recombinant vector"></img-fluid>
        <h3>2.2. Establishment of an engineered E. coli BL21(DE3) strain for expression of Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL protein</h3>
        <h4>2.2.1 Transformation</h4>
        <p>The Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL expression plasmids were then transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3), and positive clones were selected on the basis of kanamycin resistance. Many positive clones were grown on the plates (Fig. 11).</p>
        <img-fluid alt="Results_11" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/c/c5/T--AHUT_China--NewParts_02.jpg" caption="Fig. 11 Positive colonies harboring Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL expression plasmids grown on the plate with kanamycin"></img-fluid>
        <h4>2.2.2 Induced expression of Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3)</h4>
        <p>Then, with an IPTG concentration of 0.8 mM, the expression of Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL in the recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) was induced. The cells were lysed by sonication on ice, the obtained crude extract was centrifuged to separate the supernatant from debris, and the two parts were respectively subjected to SDS-PAGE. The arrow indicated in Fig. 12 was the band of Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL protein, which was consistent with the molecular weight of Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL -- about 32 kDa. It can be seen from lane 1 and 2 that IPTG apparently induced the expression of Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL protein. The results in lane 2 and 3 indicated that Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL was mainly expressed in the supernatant of cell lysate, demonstrating that Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL could be expressed as soluble protein in our engineered E. coli BL21 (DE3).</p>

        <h3>2.3. Purification of Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL protein</h3>
        <p>After confirming that Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL could be expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), the Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL protein was further purified with a nickel column. A clear band with the correct molecular weight was shown in Fig. 13. Western blot analysis using antibody for Histidine further demonstrated that this band was Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL protein (Fig.14), suggesting that Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL was efficiently purified.</p>

        <h3>2.4. Biological activity of Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL protein</h3>
        <p>Finally, MTT assay was applied to test the potential toxicity of Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL protein on Her2-positive BT-474 breast cancer cells, and the result showed that the purified Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL protein could efficiently inhibit the growth of BT-474 cells (Fig. 15).</p>

        <h2>3. Construction of an engineered EcN 1917 probiotic strain with Vgb-pelB-Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL</h2>
        <p>Based on the result that Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL protein could efficiently inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells, in order to enhance the anti-tumor effect of Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL protein, E.coli Nissle 1917 (EcN 1917), an intestinal probiotic with higher tumor-targeting ability to proliferate in hypoxic regions of tumors, was utilized as a targeted transport vector to deliver Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL protein to tumor hypoxic regions. Therefore, a new part (<partinfo name="K3981013"></partinfo>) of pET28a(+)-Vgb-pelB-linker-His-linker-Her2-linker-ISZ-Strail (Vgb-pelB-Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL for short) was constructed, in which Her2-linker-ISZ-Strail was placed under the hypoxia promoter Vgb and signal peptide pelB was added to increase the secretory expression of Her2-linker-ISZ-sTRAIL protein (Fig. 16).</p>

        <h3>3.2.Construction of an engineered EcN 1917 probiotic strain with Vgb-pelB-Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL</h3> 
        <p>The Vgb-pelB-Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL plasmid was electrotransformed into EcN 1917, and the positive colonies were screened by patching onto kanamycin LB agar plates. An antitumor engineered strain EcN 1917 (Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL) was successfully obtained (Fig. 19-1). Also the control engineered EcN 1917 (28a) was constructed (Fig. 19-2).</p>

        <p>EcN(Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL) and EcN(28a) were cultured in LB medium for 24 h. Then, the proteins in LB medium were concentrated, and subjected to Western blot analysis which was used to confirm the secretory expression of Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL by using Anti-6 × His antibody. It was shown in Fig. 20 that Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL could be efficiently expressed under the control of the hypoxia promoter Vgb and successfully secreted in the medium to exert its anti-tumor activity.</p>
