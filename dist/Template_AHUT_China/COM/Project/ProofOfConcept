        <h1>Proof of Concept</h1>
        <hr/>

        <p>According to reports, female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most common cancer, and its incidence in the population is becoming more and more youthful. Breast cancer is more likely to occur in relatively young women. Breast cancer is a phenomenon in which breast epithelial cells proliferate out of control under the action of a variety of carcinogens. The early stage of the disease often manifests as breast lumps and axillary lymph node enlargement. The cancer cells may metastasize far away, causing multiple organ disease, which is a direct threat to life.</p>

        <p>Multiple reports have proved that the use of synthetic biology to treat diseases can reduce the side effects of traditional treatment methods. Therefore, our team proposed a project that probiotic ECN can use the dual-targeting system of tumor microenvironment and Her2 receptor on cancer cells to identify cancer cells and then release ISZ-sTRAIL fusion protein to trigger the apoptosis mechanism of cells to kill cancer cells. practice.</p>
        <p>In order to realize this project, our team has repeatedly checked the data to prove: 1) Her2 artificial antibody can recognize the Her2 receptor on the surface of breast cancer cells, and further enhance the targeting effect of the treatment; 2) The soluble sTRAIL fusion protein can interact with the surface of cancer cells. The cytoplasmic death domains of death receptors DR4 and DR5 combine to transduce apoptosis signals, thereby causing cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. Based on these, our team constructed a probiotic ECN containing a hypoxia-inducible promoter, and verified its sensitivity and lethality to cancer cells through experimental verification.</p>
        <p>We use the NCBI website to find the relevant gene sequence, and then construct the pET28a-his-linker-her2-linker-ISZ-sTRAIL plasmid and pET28a-vgb-pelb-linker-his-linker-her2-linker-ISZ-sTRAIL plasmid (to the company Construction), the results of the construction are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.</p>

        <p>We transferred the obtained plasmid vector pET28a-his-linker-her2-linker-ISZ-sTRAIL into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and induced expression with IPTG, extracted and purified his-Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL. Afterwards, the activity of the soluble fusion protein was detected and identified by Western bolt technology and SDS-PAGE, and compared with the data of the group without IPTG. At the same time, the protein content in the precipitate and supernatant was also tested, compared and data were obtained. It was found that the protein in the supernatant added to the IPTG group was higher than that in the precipitate. The result is shown in Figure 3.</p>

        <p>The purified fusion protein is co-cultured with cancer cells (MCF7 breast cancer cells), the cancer cells are processed according to the designed protein concentration gradient, and ISZ-sTRAIL and sTRAIL group experiments are set to test her2—ISZ—sTRAIL fusion protein and ISZ respectively. -sTRAIL protein and sTRAIL protein have anti-tumor activity on MCF7 breast cancer cells. The results obtained are shown in Figure 4(a); it is found that our construction of plasmids expressing his-Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL fusion protein has a significant toxic effect on cancer cells mcf7. The morphology is shown in Figure 4(b), which has high efficiency in killing cancer cells in a lower concentration range.</p>

        <p>On the basis of the above, our team introduced the obtained pET28a-vgb-pelb-linker-his-linker-her2-linker-ISZ-sTRAIL plasmid into E.coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), cultured and expressed in a hypoxic environment, Using Western bolt technology to verify that hypoxia promoter can induce the expression of the fusion protein his-Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL. In this process, a control experiment of the aerobic group was set up at the same time, and the results are shown in Figure 5. The experimental results show that the pET28a-vgb-pelb-linker-his-linker-her2-linker-ISZ-sTRAIL plasmid can express the active his-Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL fusion protein in the ECN in the simulated tumor microenvironment.</p>

        <p>Through data analysis and identification of the experimental results, we found that the modified ECN can express a highly targeted and highly active his-Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL fusion protein in the tumor microenvironment, and this fusion protein is effective for cancer cells. It has obvious killing effect. For the project of transforming probiotics to double-target recognition of cancer cells and release fusion proteins to kill cancer cells, we already have a relatively complete experimental method and design process. In the future, we will continue to study the dual-targeting system and his-Her2-ISZ-sTRAIL fusion protein, and try to combine our research results with practical applications, including experimental results for pharmaceuticals and production. We will contact more medical, scientific researchers and sponsors to help the actual implementation and development of our project.</p>
