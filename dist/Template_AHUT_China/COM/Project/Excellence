        <h1>Outstanding performance in another field related to synthetic biology</h1>
        
        <h2>1. Education field</h2>
        <p>Synthetic biology has the potential to change the human world, but it is only in the development stage, and many people do not know this subject very well. During the implementation of this project, we visited the crowds and gave lectures in kindergartens and some community streets to let more people know about the IGEM project and synthetic biology. Through our propaganda, other people can have a better understanding of the content of scientific research, arouse their interest in scientific research, and plant a seed of interest in scientific research in the near future. There will surely be more researchers in the field of scientific research, who will continue to contribute to the development of the world.</p>

        <h2>2. Pharmaceutical field</h2>
        <p>It is understood that Ecoli-Nissle 1917 has been widely used in the treatment of acute diarrhea and certain intestinal diseases in infants and young children, as well as daily health products. In the literature reported in recent years, it has been found that Ecoli-Nissle 1917 is a non-toxic and harmless bacteria. , It is sensitive to the low oxygen conditions of the tumor microenvironment, thus showing the characteristics of targeting cancer cells. Therefore, our project uses this probiotic on the basis of synthetic biology. After our experimental results have been determined, and universal transformation has been carried out, medical developers can use our engineered probiotics in the cancer process to provide mammary glands. The treatment of cancer and other cancer patients provides a treatment with less side effects and less pain. At the same time, our idea of transforming probiotics to secrete toxic proteins expands the idea of developing cancer treatment drugs, is an emerging attempt in biological preparations, and provides a reference for the development of other drugs.</p>

        <h2>3. Medical science</h2>
        <p>There is no doubt that we use synthetic biology methods to transform EcN to provide new ideas for current tumor treatment. It not only provides a new idea for tumor detection and clinical treatment of tumors, but can also alleviate the problems of human organ tissue damage and function decline caused by tumor treatment to a certain extent, allowing medical staff to cure patients more safely and conveniently. We believe that with the development of synthetic biology and the gradual deepening of research on targeted tumor therapy with probiotics, the development of the medical field will advance by leaps and bounds to realize the convenience and safety of the treatment of various diseases, and bring the gospel to more diseased groups. .</p>
