        <h1>Cooperative Experiment</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>In the process of cooperation, we decided to cooperate on the experiment, so as to further understand and practice the purpose of iGEM after discussion and communication.</p>
        <hr/>

        <h2>1. AHUT help USTC</h2>
        <p>In order to deepen the public’s understanding of the iGEM project, the USTC team took the form of “ The Magic World of Synthetic Biology Week” to promote iGEM Contest. During this week, members would be divided into different groups, and use different ways to attract more people’s attention and render them understand more about the project. Here the USTC team had put our team in charge of two interesting experiments to help them achieve their goals together.</p>

        <h3>1.1 Experiment 1: extraction of DNA from fruits</h3>
        <p>Fruit:bananas</p>
        <p>Step:1）Take 100g bananas, cut it up and mash it into a fluid</p>
        <p>2）Add 30ml distilled water to make a banana fluid, then transfer it to a beaker</p>
        <p>3）Add 15ml detergent, stir it for 5 minutes or so</p>
        <p>4）Add 4g Nacl to the fluid, stir it for 5 minutes</p>
        <p>5）Filter the fluid (50ml beaker) , add 15ml ice ethanol to the filtrate, stand it still to acquire white flocculent precipitate (crude DNA extract)</p>

        <h3>1.2 Experiment 2: Fluorescence</h3>
        <p>Steps: 1) gently pipet and mix 125ml DMEM (- -) + 4 UL plasmid (2 UG), and then add 3ul P300 to pipet and mix.</p>
        <p>2) 125ml DMEM (- -) + 4ul 1: P300, gently pipet and mix</p>
        <p>3)Add the solution of step 2 to the solution of step 1, gently blow and mix</p>
        <p>4)Incubation in greenhouse for 15min</p>

        <p>In order to further deepen the cooperative relationship and let the USTC team know more about our project, we invited the USTC team to help us do the induced expression and detection experiment of eukaryotic gene in E. coli BL21 (DE3). At the same time, we can also verify the accuracy and implementation of our team's experimental project through this experiment.</p>

        <h2>3. Epilogue</h2>
        <p>Through this in-depth cooperation with USTC, we learned about the specific project content of USTC team and broadened our vision, which is what iGEM hopes we can get in coloboration.</p>
        <p>We also look forward to another in-depth cooperation with an excellent team like USTC. The results of this cooperation experiment are perfect and meet the expectations of both sides. At the same time, we also hope USTC can get a good place in this iGEM.</p>
