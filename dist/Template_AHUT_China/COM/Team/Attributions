        <p>Introduction: This year we divide the team into 4 groups: Wet lab group，Wiki group，Modeling group and English group. Since we are from a non-native English speaking country, we arrange some students to be in charge of translation and presentation in English. In this team, each student works hard to complete the tasks. Thank you to every student and instructor!</p>

        <h2>Wet lab group</h2>
        <p>There are 6 members in wet lab group. They are responsibile for different parts designed in advance.</p>
        <p>Instructor: Liang Ma、Zi Liu、Guozheng Huang、Xia Xu</p>
        
        <p>Construction of recombinant plasmid pET28a-his-linker-ISZ-sTRAIL:</p>
        <p>Yulin Peng、Chengyu Zhang、Binbin Wu</p>
        <p>They obtained the target gene by PCR with designed primers, on the basis of plasmid (pET28a-his-linker-her2-linker-ISZ-sTRAIL) sent by the company, and ligated the target gene with pET-28a in vacuo to obtain the recombinant plasmid.</p>
        <p>Protein purification: Xiangshan Cai、Yi He、Yulin Peng、Chengyu Zhang、Binbin Wu, they purified the proteins  expressed by her2-ISZ-sTRAIL and his-sTRAIL, which was sent by the company and proteins expressed by the ISZ-sTRAIL ,which we constructed.</p>
        
        <p>Cell experiments: Xiangshan Cai</p>
        <p>Document editing: Yulin Peng、Chengyu Zhang、Binbin Wu</p>
        <p>Contact: Xuechun Xie, Yi He, They are responsible for contacting with the groups of students and the University of Science and Technology of China（USTC）.</p>
